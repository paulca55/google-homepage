# Google Homepage

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css), I was set the task of building the google.com homepage (without search functionality).

In this project I used npm, gulp, Sass (SCSS syntax), flexbox and responsive web design techniques.

The finished product has been deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) using their GitHub integration and continuous deployment feature üòç
