# Google Homepage

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8ea2d4e9-fce9-4be9-94b5-acad291764a3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/paulca55-google/deploys)

As part of a course I was set the task of building the Google homepage (without search functionality).

In this project I used npm, gulp, Sass (SCSS), flexbox and responsive web design techniques.
